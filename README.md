## Hi there 👋

I am a 1st year <i>happy</i> Ph.D. student at IP Paris (IMAGINE Lab). I am supervised by [David Picard](https://davidpicard.github.io/).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on text-to-image generative models.
- 🧑‍🏫 My research lies in multi-modal generative models and the generalization of such models.
- 🌱 I am currently gaining more intuition about Diffusion Models and Flow Matching -- one timestep at a time.

⚡ Fun Fact: My profile picture is of `Arctic fox in the streets of Paris` generated using our very lightweight method. Have a look at it [**here**](https://lucasdegeorge.github.io/projects/t2i_imagenet/). The model works best with extended **long prompts**; so use an LLM to extend your prompt and get such nice images. This work is done with my very close collaborator (and friend) [Lucas Degeorge](https://github.com/lucasdegeorge#lucas-degeorge). I mostly work with him on almost everything 😉
